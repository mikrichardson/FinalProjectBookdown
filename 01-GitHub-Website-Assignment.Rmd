# GitHub Website Assignment

This assignment required the creation of a GitHub website, with a focus on workflow and and aesthetics editing. The website link for the assignment can be accessed [here](https://mikrichardson.github.io/1_rmarkdown_examples/).

## Site Description
The Cache la Poudre River, commonly referred to as the Poudre River, makes up 126 miles of Colorado's 107,000 miles of [rivers](https://www.uncovercolorado.com/rivers-in-colorado/). **The Poudre River is Colorado's only designated "Wild & Scenic" River.** The [Wild and Scenic Rivers Act](https://www.fs.usda.gov/managing-land/wild-scenic-rivers) is national legislation that protects over 13,400 miles of rivers and streams. The river originates in Rocky Mountain National Park, flowing east through Fort Collins and eventually converging with the South Platte River near [Greeley](https://www.visitftcollins.com/things-to-do/parks-open-spaces/cache-la-poudre-river/). The river corridor experiences *several diverse ecosystems* ranging from high alpine mountains to rolling plains. **The gauge site used for this analysis is located at the Lincoln Bridge in Fort Collins.**

The Poudre River site at Lincoln Bridge is:

  - Downstream of only a little bit of urban stormwater

  - Near Odell Brewing CO
  
  - Near an open space area and the Poudre River Trail
  
  - **Downstream of many agricultural diversions**

## Methods

### Data Acquisition and Plotting tests

#### Data Download


```{r downloader}

q <- readNWISdv(siteNumbers = '06752260',
                parameterCd = '00060',
                startDate = '2017-01-01',
                endDate = '2022-01-01') %>%
  rename(q = 'X_00060_00003')


```



#### Static Data Plotter


```{r, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 5}

ggplot(q, aes(x = Date, y = q)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  ylab('Q (cfs)') + 
  ggtitle('Discharge in the Poudre River, Fort Collins')

```


#### Interactive Data Plotter


```{r}

q_xts <- xts(q$q, order.by = q$Date)


dygraph(q_xts) %>%
  dyOptions(drawPoints = TRUE, pointSize = 2) %>%
  dyAxis("y", label = "Discharge (cfs)")
```



## Assignment 


This assignment will be primarily about demonstrating some expertise in using
RMarkdown, since we will be using Rmds as the primary form of homework and 
assignments. With that in mind, your assignment for this homework is to:


1) Fork the example repository into your personal GitHub

2) Create an RStudio project from your Personal clone of the Repo. 

3) Create a table of contents that is floating, but displays three levels of
headers instead of two (by editing the content at the beginning of the document)

4) Make a version of the `dygraph` with points and lines by using rstudio's
dygraph [guide](https://rstudio.github.io/dygraphs/)

5) Writing a paragraph on the Poudre river with at least three hyperlinks,
**two bolded sections**, and one *italicized phrase*. The content of this paragraph
is not vital, but try to at least make it true and interesting, and, of course,
don't plagiarize. 

6) Knit that document, and then git commit and push to your personal GitHub.

7) Use the GitHub -> Settings -> Pages tab to create a website of your report.

8) Bonus, make the timestamp in the header dynamic. As in it only adds
todays date, not just a static date you enter. 

9) Bonus, create an "index_talk.Rmd" version of your document using the
`revealjs` package. Add link to your original report-style document.
